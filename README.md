The image classifier api for OpenGeoResearch. It was developed to filter images 
with inappropriate content or human faces. The classifier uses 
[Keras model of NSFW detector](https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model) and 
[RetinaFace: Deep Face Detection Library for Python](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface) 
to inspect the given images.

OpenGeoResearch was a research project to expand geo-sciences through active participation of citizens.
OpenGeoResearch was used to collect and answer spatially related questions, with a wide range of questions
successfully answered by experts and new research questions identified.

More Information regarding the project can be found here: [OpenGeoResearch Homepage](https://www.opengeoresearch.org/)
